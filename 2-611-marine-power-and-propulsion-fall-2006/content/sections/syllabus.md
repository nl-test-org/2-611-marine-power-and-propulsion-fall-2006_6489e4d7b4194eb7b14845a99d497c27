Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Description
-----------

This course discusses the selection and evaluation of commercial and naval ship power and propulsion systems. It will cover the analysis of propulsors, prime mover thermodynamic cycles, propeller-engine matching, propeller selection, waterjet analysis, and reviews alternative propulsors. The course also investigates thermodynamic analyses of Rankine, Brayton, Diesel, and Combined cycles, reduction gears and integrated electric drive. Battery operated vehicles and fuel cells are also discussed. The term project requires analysis of alternatives in propulsion plant design for given physical, performance, and economic constraints. Graduate students complete different assignments and exams.

Objective
---------

1.  Understand principles of propulsors. Demonstrate ability to specify preliminary design parameters for a given vessel propulsor.
2.  Understand principles of thermodynamics with emphasis on power cycles. Demonstrate ability to specify preliminary design parameters for a given vessel propulsion system.
3.  Understand systems trade offs in developing preliminary power system design for a vessel.
